## üîß Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/healthcare-system.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd healthcare-system

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Running the Pipelines

```python
from src.pipelines import UnifiedPipeline

# Initialize pipeline
pipeline = UnifiedPipeline()

# Process data
processed_data = pipeline.process(data_path='path/to/data')

# Train model
model = pipeline.train_model(processed_data)
```

### Starting the Web Interface

```bash
# Navigate to web directory
cd src/web

# Run the application
python app.py
```

Visit `http://localhost:5000` in your browser to access the web interface.
